4.1 Request Displayed Weight (SMA#1)
Command: <LF>W<CR>
Response: Scale returns Weight and status information immediately.
<LF><s><r><n><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.5 Request Scale to Zero (SMA#1)
Command: <LF>Z<CR>
Response: Scale attempts to zero itself and reports zero status in the <s> status indicator.
Note: in many locations latching the scale zero command is not permitted.
The specific conditions for scale zeroing will meet proper Weights and Measures
criteria.
<LF><s><r><n><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.6 Request Scale to Tare
Command: <LF>T<CR>
Response: Scale attempts to tare itself using the weight on the scale display and reports
the tare status in the <s> and <n> status indicators. If a tare error occurred this
is only a momentary error status indicator and will be cleared on the next
command cycle.
Note: in many locations latching the scale Tare command is not permitted.
The specific conditions for scale tare will meet proper Weights and Measures
criteria.
<LF><s><r><N><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.7 Set Scale Tare Weight
Command: <LF>T<xxxxxx.xxx><CR>
Response: Scale attempts to take the <xxxxxx.xxx> data as the tare weight and reports
the tare status in the <s> and <n> status indicators. If a tare error occurred this
is only a momentary error status indicator and will be cleared on the next
command cycle.
<LF><s><r><N><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.8 Return Tare Weight
Command: <LF>M<CR>
Response: Scale returns tare weight stored in scale Memory and identifies the weight as
tare in the <n> status indicator.
<LF><s><r><T><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.9 Clear Scale Tare Weight
Command: <LF>C<CR>
Response: Scale Clears tare weight and reports the tare status in the <n> status indicator.
<LF><s><r><G><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.12 Invoke Scale Diagnostics (SMA#1)
Command: <LF>D<CR>
Response: The scale runs scale diagnostics and sends a diagnostic response message with
the results of the tests.
See Section 5.4 for response details.
<LF><r><e><c><m><CR>

4.13 About Scale First Line (SMA#1)
Command: <LF>A<CR>
Response: The scale will send the first line of the About scale data.
See Section 5.5 for response details.
<LF><SMA>:<yyyyyy><CR>

4.14 About Scale Scroll (SMA#1)
Command: <LF>B<CR>
Response: The scale will send the rest of the ABout the scale data.
See Section 5.5 for response details.
<LF><MFG>:<yyyyyy><CR>

4.17 Extended Command Set (custom)
Command: <LF>Xc<CR>
Response: This is the only two-character command in this protocol. It is intended for the
manufacturer to extend or customize the protocol for uses outside the scope of
this standard.
‘c’ is any printable ASCII character the manufacturer desires.
<LF><manufacturers specified response><CR>
  Command: <LF>XC<CR>
  Response: Scale clears tare weight, zeros, then reports the expected weight to
  add. It measures for 2 minutes, then determines the new sensitivity, reporting 
  the new measured weight after completion.
  <LF><C><r><G><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

  <LF><s><r><G><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>
  
  Command: <LF>XC<xxxxxx.xxx><CR>
  Response: Scale clears tare weight, zeros, then uses the provided weight to
  calibrate (reports back for verification). It measures for 2 minutes, then 
  determines the new sensitivity, reporting the new measured weight after 
  completion.
  <LF><C><r><G><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

  <LF><s><r><G><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>

4.18 Abort Command (SMA#1)
Command: <ESC>
Response: This is the only command that the scale receives which does not follow the
<LF>c<CR> protocol and does not have a response. This was implemented
this way so that the <ESC> character can be detected at the scales “*Data
Link Layer” and a software reset generated regardless of what the scale is
doing at the time. This software reset should reset the communication hardware
and clear any pending commands that the scale is acting on. This command
is needed to reset the scale if the host has commanded the scale to
perform an operation that has taken longer than the host is willing to wait.
After the <ESC> command is issued the host should wait several seconds
before trying to communicate with the scale to ensure the scale has completed
its software reset cycle. It is recommended that the host then issue a simple
“About” command ‘A’ to validate that the scale is again communicating
properly.

4.19.1 Repeat Displayed Weight Continuously
Command: <LF>R<CR>
Response: Scale Repeats weight and status information continuously until another
command is received.
<LF><s><r><n><m><f><xxxxxx.xxx><uuu><CR>
